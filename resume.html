        <h4> Co-op Associate </h4>
        <p> This is a consumer electronics company with which I did my co-op work terms. When I joined, my manager explained that she wanted me to become an expert on Salesforce, their CRM because they were switching over to a new interface and wanted to maintain CSR productivity levels throughout the transition. She also explained some hurdles they were facing with trying to customize elements for a website they were making with Salesforce Website Builder. </p>
